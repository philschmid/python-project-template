# Python Project Template

This is a template for Python projects. It is intended to be a starting point for new projects, and provides a structure that can be used consistently across projects.

Documentation: https://philschmid.github.io/python-project-template/

## Getting Started

Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, run the following commands to rename all folders, files and variable from `myproject` to the name of your project:

```bash
newproject="mynewproject"
# rename and delete the project folder
mv  myproject/ mynewproject/
# rename the project in the pyproject.toml file
sed -i "" "s/myproject/mynewproject/g" pyproject.toml
```

Adjust documentation in `docs/index.md` and `README.md` to your needs.

## Scipts

The following scripts are available:

- `make style`: run the ruff fix
- `make check`: run the ruff check
- `make test`: run the tests
